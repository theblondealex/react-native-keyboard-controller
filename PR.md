# Fix: Add DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme to Jest Mock

## 🔧 Problem Summary

The Jest mock for `react-native-keyboard-controller` was missing the `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` export, causing test failures when components tried to access theme properties. This resulted in `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dark')` errors during testing.

## 🚨 Error Details

### The Issue
When developers tried to use `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` in their components within a Jest testing environment, they encountered:

```typescript
// This would fail in tests
import { DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

export const toolBarTheme = {
  ...DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme, // ❌ DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme is undefined
  dark: {
    ...DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme.dark, // ❌ Cannot read 'dark' of undefined
    primary: Color.Green,
    background: Color.GreyBackground,
  },
  light: {
    ...DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme.light, // ❌ Cannot read 'light' of undefined
    primary: Color.Green,
    background: Color.GreyBackground,
  },
};
```

### Error Message
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dark')
```

## ✅ Solution

Added the missing `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` export to the Jest mock file (`jest/index.js`) with proper theme structure matching the actual library implementation.

### Changes Made

1. **Added DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme object** with light and dark mode configurations:
   ```javascript
   const DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme = {
     light: {
       primary: "#2c2c2c",
       disabled: "#B0BEC5", 
       background: "#f3f3f4",
       ripple: "#bcbcbcbc",
     },
     dark: {
       primary: "#fafafa",
       disabled: "#707070",
       background: "#2C2C2E", 
       ripple: "#F8F8F888",
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Added the export** to the mock object:
   ```javascript
   const mock = {
     // ... existing exports
     // themes
     DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme,
   };
   ```

## 🎯 Benefits

### ✅ Immediate Benefits
- **Eliminates test failures** when using `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` in components
- **Removes need for custom workarounds** in test suites
- **Improves developer experience** with consistent Jest mock behavior

### ✅ Developer Experience Improvements
- **Simplified test setup** - no need for custom mocks
- **Consistent behavior** between runtime and test environments
- **Better test reliability** for keyboard-related components

### ✅ Maintenance Benefits  
- **Backward compatible** - no breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Low risk** - only affects Jest testing environment
- **Future-proof** - aligns mock with actual library exports

## 🧪 Testing

### Before the Fix
```bash
# Tests would fail with:
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dark')
```

### After the Fix
```bash
# Tests now pass successfully
✓ should render without crashing
✓ should render the component with custom theme
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ All existing Jest mock functionality continues to work
2. ✅ Components using `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` render in tests
3. ✅ Theme customization works properly in test environment
4. ✅ No breaking changes to existing test suites

## 📁 Files Modified

- `jest/index.js` - Added `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme` definition and export

## 🎪 Impact Assessment

### Risk Level: **LOW** ⚡
- Only affects Jest mock behavior
- No runtime changes
- Fully backward compatible

### Benefit Level: **HIGH** 🚀
- Fixes broken test scenarios
- Improves developer productivity
- Eliminates need for workarounds

### Affected Users
- ✅ Projects using `react-native-keyboard-controller` with Jest
- ✅ Teams writing tests for keyboard-related components  
- ✅ Developers customizing keyboard toolbar themes

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects
**No migration needed!** This fix is backward compatible.

### For Projects with Custom Workarounds
You can now remove custom Jest mocks for `DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme`:

```javascript
// ❌ No longer needed
jest.doMock("react-native-keyboard-controller", () => {
  const originalMock = require("react-native-keyboard-controller/jest");
  return {
    ...originalMock,
    DefaultKeyboardToolbarTheme: { /* custom theme */ },
  };
});

// ✅ Just use the official mock
jest.mock("react-native-keyboard-controller", () =>
  require("react-native-keyboard-controller/jest")
);
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

This fix resolves a common pain point for developers testing components that use keyboard toolbar themes. The implementation is straightforward, low-risk, and significantly improves the testing experience without any breaking changes.

The solution aligns the Jest mock behavior with the actual library exports, ensuring consistent developer experience across development and testing environments.
